# xkcd handler

A simple handler for `xkcd://` links. Will evaluate to `xdg-open https://xkcd.com/$1`.

xkcd strips are fun little comic strips about a variety of topics. Sometimes I cite them to make a point or whatever.

## Rationale

I have too much time, and I am too lazy too write out the whole URL. Also, I thought it would be funny.

## Contributing

Please contribute your package manager to `dist/` to further share the good vibes.

## License

Do whatever you want. Don't sue me. Don't sell my dumb scripts without asking me.
